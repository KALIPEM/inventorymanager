# Inventory Simulator
A game that focuses on helping business students learn about Inventory management, and help college professors teach it more efficiently. This game focuses on
Sourcing from Mexico and China, and calculating the amount of stock you have and sourcing from either Mexico or China or from both and making sure you never run out of stock. There is one condition when you order from Mexico the stock will be delivered within 2 weeks and when you order from china it will only be delivered within 4 weeks. STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!
